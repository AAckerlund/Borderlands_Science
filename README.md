To change the graph being used you will need to edit both graph.txt and validColors.txt as follows.

If the space is empty enter a 0

If the space contains a Flak token enter a 1.

If the space contains a Zane token enter a 2.

If the space contains a Amara token enter a 3.

If the space contains a Moze toekn enter a 4.

*Note for validColors.txt*
