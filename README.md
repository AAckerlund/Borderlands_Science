This program implements a brute force algorithm that is designed to solve the Borderlands 3 Borderlands Science mini game for puzzle solutions that will yield the highest possible score.

If I did my math correctly, this algorithm has a time complexity around O(n<sup>n</sup>) which is to say that if it can do it in 14 minutes, you can do it in 30 seconds.

To execute the program simply run the .jar file.
    
*Note* After entering the number of spacer blocks that area available the program may appear to be stuck in an infinite loop. This is not the case, it just takes an absurd amount of time to execute (remember that time complexity?). I would suggest going and doing something short (15-20 minutes) yet productive while you wait for it to finish execution.
